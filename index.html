			<h2>General Data Protection Regulation - What is GDPR?</h2>
          <p>
                The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR") is a regulation
		  in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the 
		  European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses
		  the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily
		  to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the
		  regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation
		  within the EU.[1] Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation
		  contains provisions and requirements pertaining to the processing of personal data
		  of individuals (formally called data subjects in the GDPR) inside the EEA,
		  and applies to an enterprise established in the EEA or—regardless of its location
		  and the data subjects' citizenship—that is processing the personal information of
		  data subjects inside the EEA. 
          </p>


          <p>
                Controllers of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organisational
		  measures to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle
		  personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and
		  provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using pseudonymization or full
		  anonymization where appropriate), and use the highest-possible privacy settings by
		  default, so that the data is not available publicly without explicit, informed consent,
		  and cannot be used to identify a subject without additional information stored separately.
		  No personal data may be processed unless it is done under a lawful basis specified by
		  the regulation, or unless the data controller or processor has received an unambiguous
		  and individualized affirmation of consent from the data subject. The data subject has
		  the right to revoke this consent at any time. 
          </p>
	    
	    
	    <p>
	    A processor of personal data must clearly disclose any data collection, declare the lawful
		    basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and
		    if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Data subjects have
		    the right to request a portable copy of the data collected by a processor in a common
		    format, and the right to have their data erased under certain circumstances. Public
		    authorities, and businesses whose core activities centre around regular or systematic
		    processing of personal data, are required to employ a data protection officer (DPO),
		    who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report any 
		    data breaches within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In
		    some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the
		    annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise,
		    whichever is greater. 
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    The GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016, and became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018. As the
		    GDPR is a regulation, not a directive, it is directly binding and applicable. 
        </p>
